This mod is an addon to my Cyberpunk mod. As such, it will require my Cyberpunk mod to work.


Currently, this mod adds the following Cyberpunk 2020 corps as factions:
Arasaka 
Militech
Lazarus
IEC
Petrochem
Sovoil

It also changes tribes to nomads.

Future updates to this mod will further tweak these factions to differentiate them a bit more.  
Discussion, constructive criticism and new ideas are always welcome.
